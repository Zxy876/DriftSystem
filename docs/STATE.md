## 2. Current Goal
- Monitor the restored NPC interaction and quest_event trigger loop from Phase 26 while awaiting the Phase 27 charter to continue campaign polish.

## 3. Progress – Done
- Capabilities already achieved:
	- Phase 26 restored plugin-side NPC interaction listeners so right-clicking featured NPCs emits canonical quest_events with cooldown feedback, unblocking tutorial and flagship beats end-to-end.
	- Phase 25 self-healing diagnostics log orphan rule_events with context-aware suggestions; QuestRuntime exposes orphan history and StoryEngine stores SequenceMatcher-ranked auto-heal hints, documented in `docs/TASK_AUTOFIX.md` and covered by `backend/test_task_autofix.py`.
	- Natural-language level generation now infers quest tasks, listeners, trigger zones, and milestones automatically (Phase 23), with verification covering quest log HUD integration and rule-event progression.
	- Task debugging stack delivered in Phase 24: QuestRuntime captures rule snapshots, `/world/story/{player}/debug/tasks` exposes live state, and `/taskdebug` overlays reveal pending milestones under operator-only permissions.
	- Structured level extensions plus automated stage setup (scene generator, safe teleports, minimap integration).
	- Beat progression engine: StoryEngine registers level beats with `EventManager`, reacts to chat/near/interact triggers, and emits beat-scoped world patches.
	- QuestRuntime synchronizes beat-issued tasks, tracks rule references, and exposes `/world/story/rule-event` for bridge catalysts.
	- FastAPI endpoints and legacy plugin commands still load levels and apply world patches end-to-end.
	- Scene-aware plugin executor stores applied patches via `SceneLoader`/`SceneCleanupService`, auto-reversing builds when backend sends `_scene_cleanup`.
	- `RuleEventBridge` now forwards near-NPC events back to `/world/story/rule-event`, closing the basic rule trigger loop.
	- Scene metadata is now emitted via world patches, enabling plugin-side SceneAwareWorldPatchExecutor to track and clean scene sessions.
	- QuestRuntime TaskSessions normalize task definitions, track milestones/rewards, and respond to rule-event callbacks with aggregated nodes/world patches.
	- QuestRuntime now returns task titles/hints and RuleEventBridge renders progress/milestones with streamlined quest log chat formatting.
	- Flagship tutorial trigger pipeline canonicalized: quest events, tutorial JSON, RuleEventBridge, NPCManager, and WorldPatchExecutor now agree on canonical identifiers so milestones and task completions fire deterministically.
	- Cinematic beats now trigger for level_01’s checkpoint/finish, level_03’s summit climb, and the tutorial launch portal with coordinated titles, particles, and environment shifts.
	- NPCBehaviorEngine records rulegraph bindings and emits dialogue/command/world patch updates when rule events fire.
	- `/world/story/rule-event` exposes task/NPC deltas directly for the plugin transport to consume.
	- Plugin bridge now applies rule-event `world_patch` payloads, emits quest/milestone chat beats, and dispatches backend `commands` to the server console.
	- Phase 4 contract is documented in `docs/PHASE4_TASK_CONTRACT.md`, covering task sessions, NPC bindings, and plugin duties.
	- ExitIntentDetector listens to Phase 5 exit aliases, calls `/world/story/end`, and applies the returned cleanup + hub teleport.
	- StoryEngine now records enter/exit trajectories, exposes exit profiles in `get_public_state`, and returns hub teleport summaries.
	- Heart level content migrated to schema v2.0: every chapter carries beats/scene/rules/tasks/exit scaffolding and emits `_scene` metadata for the plugin cleanup loop.
	- Key NPC hubs (level_01, level_03, tutorial_level) now expose polished behaviors, rule listeners, and `npc_skins` metadata to make roles visually distinct.
	- StoryGraph now canonicalizes numeric level ids, records player trajectories, and produces weighted next-level recommendations consumed by StoryEngine.
	- Minecraft plugin surfaces StoryGraph recommendations via `/recommend` HUD with action-bar prompts and clickable chat shortcuts.
	- Quest log HUD renders active tasks/milestones via `/questlog`, auto-refreshing on level entry, rule events, and exits with milestone action-bar cues.
	- Story choices UI powers beat-defined branches: ChoicePanel renders options, RuleEventBridge forwards selections, and StoryGraph biases recommendations based on recorded decisions.
	- Flagship arc chapters now share continuity metadata (`storyline_theme`, `next_major_level`, lighting/weather cues) and StoryGraph applies a theme-weighted bias to keep players on the flagship spine.
	- Phase 22 verification completed: FastAPI TestClient replayed flagship_03/08/12/final Level 3 & 4 flows, confirmed quest_event milestones, and documented the milestone-deduplication workaround needed for `flagship_final`.

## 4. Progress – In Progress
- Capabilities under active review:
	- Observe live NPC interaction telemetry to ensure cooldowns and quest_event forwarding remain responsive across scene resets.
	- Monitor orphan detection confidence scores across flagship/tutorial chapters and tune thresholds if false positives surface.
	- Prototype plugin-side consumption flows that surface auto-heal hints to operators without mutating live task data.
	- Plan follow-up telemetry to correlate orphan logs with StoryEngine memory updates for live-ops dashboards.

## 5. Latest Code Updates (to be auto-updated from git diff or manual input)
```
- Minecraft plugin's `NearbyNPCListener` now listens for `PlayerInteractAtEntityEvent`, surfaces action-bar feedback, and emits canonical quest_event payloads with per-NPC throttling to close the action trigger loop (Phase 26).
- QuestRuntime now records orphan rule_events with auto-heal suggestions, StoryEngine stores SequenceMatcher-ranked hints, and debug snapshots expose diagnostics for operator tooling (Phase 25).
- `docs/TASK_AUTOFIX.md` documents the detection pipeline and `backend/test_task_autofix.py` verifies orphan hints and StoryEngine state propagation.
- Emotional weather system maps `xinyue.face_once` / `xinyue.escape_once` into level-defined patches and merges weather, lighting, and music in real time.
- Task debugging endpoint `/world/story/{player}/debug/tasks` and `/taskdebug` overlay expose live QuestRuntime state for operators with token-gated access.
- Flagship tutorial task, milestone, and plugin trigger pipeline now uses canonical quest_event names end-to-end, with QuestRuntime milestone matching and `/world/story/rule-event` payloads verified via automated backend tests.
- SceneAwareWorldPatchExecutor now consumes `npc_emotion` payloads so hub NPC nameplates and dialogue tone react to emotional profiles.
- `GET /world/story/{player_id}/emotional-weather` returns the active profile, tone, and last applied patch for debugging.
- QuestRuntime now exposes `active_tasks` snapshots with remaining counts, task titles, and milestone names for HUD rendering.
- New `/world/story/{player_id}/quest-log` endpoint delivers quest log payloads and accompanying summary metadata.
- QuestLogHud surfaces structured quest details via `/questlog`, auto-refreshes on level entry, and fires action-bar notifications on milestones/completions.
	- NPC dialogue HUD renders cinematic conversations with typing cadence, right-click activation, and nameplate styling; skin metadata now flows from scenes into the plugin.
- RuleEventBridge forwards quest snapshots to the HUD and relays milestone events without duplicating chat spam.
- `level_01.json` exit metadata repaired so StoryGraph loads all heart levels without JSON warnings.
- CinematicController sequences fades, slow-motion, particles, and camera pans for heart-level beats and `/cinematic test` validation.
- StoryEngine `CINEMATIC_LIBRARY` now emits preset cinematics for level_01 podium and level_03 summit transitions.
- ChoicePanel intercepts `story_choice` nodes, renders numbered options, and emits `rule_event` payloads so StoryEngine can resolve branches.
- StoryEngine records `choice_history`, surfaces prompt metadata, and updates StoryGraph with `next_level`/tag affinities to personalize recommendations.
	- Flagship arc now persists `xinyue.*` memory flags (admitted pain, face/escape loops, summit progress) to retarget NPC tone, cinematics, and StoryGraph affinity.
- Flagship tutorial/03/08/12 JSONs now surface `storyline_theme`, `continuity`, and `next_major_level` metadata with lighting/weather transitions for smoother arc hand-offs.
- StoryGraph now applies a storyline theme continuity bias to keep flagship chapters linked unless player intent diverges.
- Emotional weather pipeline merges level-defined profiles, shifts weather/lighting/music on memory changes, and exposes hub tone updates via `/world/story/{player}/emotional-weather`.
- `/world/story/generate-level` synthesizes flagship-format user chapters, saves them under `generated/`, and hot-reloads StoryGraph + MiniMap layouts.
- Recommendation weights now track player-authored tag interest and highlight the latest generated chapter for seamless follow-up.
- First flagship campaign loop assembled: tutorial guidance updated, `flagship_final` delivers memory-dependent endings, continuity `next_major_level` links flagship chapters, and StoryGraph bias surfaces 终章推荐 entry points。
	- `flagship_final.json` now binds face/escape branches into distinct cinematics, records `xinyue.campaign_complete`, and syncs emotional weather/Scene metadata for the plugin cleanup loop.
```

## 7. Next Actions (task-based, GPT readable)
- [ ] QA NPC interaction loop: tutorial → flagship checkpoints, confirming quest_event progression without relying on free-text chat fallbacks.
- [x] QA Face-path 主线：Tutorial → 03 → 08 → 12 → finale，验证晨光结局的摄像机与情绪补丁平滑衔接。
- [ ] Review orphan rule_event telemetry on staging and adjust SequenceMatcher thresholds if confidence skews low/high.
- [ ] Pair with plugin team on presenting auto-heal hints to operators without mutating live milestone state.
- [ ] Capture orphan frequency vs milestone completion metrics for upcoming live-ops dashboards.
- [ ] QA Escape-path 主线：确认夜行循环结局保持灯光/音乐同步，并正确记录 `xinyue.campaign_complete`。

## 8. Risks
- Hub teleport assumes KunmingLakeHub world is loaded; server ops should validate availability after restarts.
- Exit aliases are aggressive; future tuning may add per-level cooldowns to avoid accidental triggers.
- Task debug endpoint hinges on a shared token; leaked credentials would expose live quest state, so per-environment rotation and secret management remain critical.
- Action-bar feedback for NPC interactions depends on Adventure API support; legacy server builds may require fallback chat messaging.

## 9. Notes (high-level intent)
- This document is the central source of truth for shared world state; update collaboratively as plans evolve
