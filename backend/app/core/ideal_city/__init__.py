# Ideal City core package placeholder.
# Responsibility: group Ideal City specific abstractions without importing implementation modules.
# Prohibited: triggering side effects or binding legacy Drift content during import.

# COMPLETED[CEC-PACKAGE-01][阶段: 接口占位]: Package index documents where Ideal City abstractions live.
#   • `device_spec` module: semantic field definitions for player proposals.
#   • `adjudication_contract` module: world-sovereign verdict envelope and guardrails.
#   • `execution_boundary` module: post-ruling propagation notes and zero-mod constraints.
#   • Linked references: docs/IDEAL_CITY_ENGINEERING_LANGUAGE.md and MIGRATION_IDEAL_CITY.md provide governance context.
